PLG_EXTENSIONTRANSLATOR="<h1>Extension Translator v1.0.0</h1>

<p>A plugin that translates Joomla! extension's language files to corresponding content language. It creates new language files with translation.<br/>
It's useful when you have an extension that doesn't have a translation to the desired language.<br/>
It uses <a href='https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/quickstart-client-libraries' target='_blank' >Google Cloud Translation API</a> - AI & Machine Learning Products.</p>

<p>How does it work: It checks all default language .ini files and looks for the other language files. If not found then it translates the file.<br/>
If the file exists then it checks all text lines to make sure that all text lines are translated, and it translates if necessary</p>

<p>The service is not free, Google Cloud charges about 20 cents per thousand of translations.</p>"
